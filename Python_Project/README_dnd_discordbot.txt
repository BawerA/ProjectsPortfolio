#The dnd_discordbot is still a work in progress. This was a side project used to create a Dungeons and Dragons bot for character creation, dice rolling, and to access lore in the word.

#The bot is not up yet, but it is integreated with discord developer portal.

#The simple functions that the bot has is when it knows when a user enters or leaves the server, can roll 1d4 dice, and can roll a race and class for the user.

#More developement will be added in the future.
