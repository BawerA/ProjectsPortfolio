# HTML Project
#Within these files you will see my first HTML project that I created that landed me my first internship. I was taking a course to learn the markup languages HTML5 and CSS3
where I created this sample website. To run the website completely please download all the file/folders within the first folder labeled 'HTML_Project'.
#This website was suppose to be a fake food provider named 'OMNIFood'
