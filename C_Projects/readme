#These files are a list of coding projects that I have created with the programming language C.

#integerConversion.c is a code that allows the user to enter a number between 1-1,000,000. It will return the users number in decimal,
hexidecimal, octal, and binary number then ask the user if they want to save the file into a text file.

#integerbyNine.c is a program that ask the user to enter a number between 1-999999, once the user enters the number the program
will response and add all the invidual digits of the number and see if it is divisable by 9.

#numberProgram.c is a very simple program that I created that will ask the user for an integer to input. The program will take the
integer and tells the user if the number is either positive or negative and if it is either even or odds.
